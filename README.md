# Napoli-landing-page-final
This is the latest version of my hometown landing page. 
I wanted to capture the essence of Napoli, a city often photographed in black and white but made of a thousand colors. 
I am currently working to refactor the code ( css) and reviewing the translation functions for the headings as I have had to amend html a bit. 
I have just made the website responsive for mobile, need to work on fixing the responsiveness for ipad/tablet. 
I aim to finish this basic project by the end of the week. 
Hopefully this showcases how much I love my hometown and how badly I miss it :)
