        Located in the south-west of Italy, Naples is one of the oldest cities
        in the world.<br />
        Naples was founded by the Greeks about 600 B.C. as Νεάπολις (“New
        City”).
        <br />
        Ancient Neapolis, as Gibbon says:
        <em
          >"long cherished the language and manners of a Grecian colony;and the
          choice of Virgil had ennobled this elegant retreat, which attracted
          the lovers of repose and study from the noise, the smoke, and the
          laborious opulence of Rome".</em
        >
        <br />
        Nowadays, Napoli attracts tourists from all over the world, <br />for
        its landscapes, history and delicious food. <br />But even for a local,
        it is hard to fully express or comprehend the beauty of Napoli as it is
        made of <em>"mille culure"</em>(a thousand colors).

        <strong>Pizza</strong> is one of the best-known and loved Italian
        culinary creations.
        <br />
        It is so important that in 2017 the art of Neapolitan pizza-making was
        honored with UNESCO
        <em><strong>“intangible cultural heritage”</strong></em> status.
        <br />Modern pizza can be traced to Naples in the
        <strong>early 19th century</strong>, its story really dates to the
        flatbreads of the ancient Etruscans who settled in Italy in the 8th
        Century BC. <br />From archeological remains, we know that they made a
        sort of thick dough from ground grains, which was baked beneath hot
        ashes and then topped with seasoned oils, herbs, and other available
        ingredients. <br />The invention of
        <strong> Pizza Margherita</strong> dates back to 1889 and to a
        Neapolitan pizza maker named <strong>Raffaele Esposito</strong> who
        wanted to honor the visit to Naples by
        <strong>Queen Margherita of Savoy</strong> and her husband, King Umberto
        I. <br />The ingredients were to represent
        <strong>the colors of the Italian flag</strong>:
        <strong>red</strong>(tomatoes),<strong>white</strong> (mozzarella), and
        <strong>green</strong> (basil).

        Mount Vesuvius is a somma-stratovolcano located on the Gulf of Naples in
        Campania, Italy, about 9 km (5.6 mi) east of Naples and a short distance
        from the shore. <br />It is one of several volcanoes forming the
        Campanian volcanic arc and it consists of a large cone partially
        encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera, resulting from the
        collapse of an earlier, much higher structure. <br />The eruption of
        Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii,
        Herculaneum, Oplontis, Stabiae, and several other settlements.

        Some relationships are meant to last forever. None more so than Diego
        Armando Maradona and SSC Napoli. <br />This was a relationship that had
        it all. Every possible emotion and feeling. <br />Especially love that
        35 years on from their first date together has never wavered. <br />From
        day one, Diego immediately felt at home in Naples. He had grown up in
        extreme poverty in Argentina. In Naples, he would find a team, city and
        public that endured the same problems as he did growing up. <br />It was
        a dysfunctional, yet hugely passionate city when it came to football.
